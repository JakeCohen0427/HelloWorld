Write a method isLeapYear with a parameter of type int named year.

The parameter needs to be greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 9999.

If the parameter is not in that range return false.

Otherwise, if it is in the valid range, calculate if the year is a leap year and return true if it is a leap year, otherwise return false.
